# Analyzing-and-Visualizing-Financial-Data

For my FIN 654: Financial Analytics coursework, I worked on a project to analyze and visualize the financial data. The entire project was done using **R Programming.** 

**Analysis:**
1. Creating multiple new columns example Date column.
2. Calculating financial terms (Risk-free rate; Market Excess Returns)
3. Calculating Null value percentages and Dropping columns with a high percentage.
4. Performing **Descriptive Statistics** for multiple companies.
5. Analyzing significant firms using their Financial history.
6. Performing multiple **statistical tests** for understanding their history.
7. Creating **visualization graphs and plots** like a histogram and Q-Q plots.
8. Indexing all the data for faster retrieval in the future**
9. Performing **OLS Regression** on each firmâ€™s data.
10. Developing multiple **Time-Series models.**
11. Calculating Portfolio returns for each firm.
12. Performing **Hypothesis Testing** on the data.
